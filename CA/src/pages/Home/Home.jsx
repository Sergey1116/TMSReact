        <h2>Cost Accounting</h2>
      <p>Cost accounting is defined as "a systematic set of procedures for recording and reporting measurements of the cost of manufacturing goods and performing 
          services in the aggregate and in detail. It includes methods for recognizing, classifying, allocating, aggregating and reporting such costs and comparing 
          them with standard costs." Often considered a subset of managerial accounting, its end goal is to advise the management on how to optimize business practices 
          and processes based on cost efficiency and capability. Cost accounting provides the detailed cost information that management needs to control current operations and plan for the future.</p>
        <p>Since managers are making decisions only for their own organization, there is no need for the information to be comparable to similar information from other 
            organizations. Instead, information must be relevant to a particular environment. Cost accounting information is commonly used in financial accounting, but 
            its primary function is for use by managers to facilitate their decision-making.</p>
